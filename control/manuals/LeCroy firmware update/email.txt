Hi,

My first thought is to which version of firmware you are using? It
should be 7.9.1.3, if not then upgrade it by downloading it to a
memory stick and upgrading it. Get it here

If this doesn't solve the problem then please email me again.

A new Website Technical Support Request has been entered for: 

Scopes and Accessories, Oscilloscopes category

A question was asked regarding:WaveSurfer 3000 Oscilloscopes

WaveSurfer 3024

Customer has requested to be contacted regarding the following
message: 
*IDN? returns LECROY,WS3024,LCRY3703N15293,7.9.0

When communicating over TCPIP, the scope returns "WARNING : CURRENT
REMOTE CONTROL INTERFACE IS TCPIP" and refuses to execute commands or
answer queries; only *IDN? works.

Have tried changing setting to USBTMC and OFF; scope still refuses to
do as it''s told.

Please advise. Many thanks.
